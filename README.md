- You can run web app by executing these commands in its corresponding folder
   - python manage.py migrate
   - python manage.py makemigrations
   - python manage.py runserver

- After that you can open the website on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- And if you want to access the admin page, you must run python manage.py createsuperuser first
