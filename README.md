# Build Library Management System | Python & Django
 
- In this project I build a Library System with Django Framework and Python.
 Django is one of the best frameworks for developing web applications that looks awesome 

- I build a library system with:
    - adding new books
    - adding books categories
    - adding books Author
    - adding image of books and the Author of it 
    - adding books prices for rent or sell 
    - display number of books in the library
    - display number of books which are sold or rented and avalible books in the library
    - display profits of sold and rented books
    

- You can run web app by executing these commands in its corresponding folder
   - python manage.py migrate
   - python manage.py makemigrations
   - python manage.py runserver

- After that you can open the website on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- And if you want to access the admin page, you must run python manage.py createsuperuser first
